📸 → 🔢 Teaching AI to Count Calories

Ever wished you could just take a photo of your meal and instantly know the nutritional content? I built exactly that!

After struggling with traditional calorie tracking apps (who has time to manually log "150g of chicken breast, 2 cups of rice"?), I decided to leverage AI to solve this problem.

**The Result:**
A full-featured web app that analyzes food photos using a vision-language model and returns comprehensive nutritional information - food items, portions, grams, calories, and complete macronutrient breakdown.

**The Journey:**
🔧 Integrated Qwen 2.5 Vision-Language Model (7B)
🎨 Built a modern, responsive interface with professional UI/UX
⚡ Optimized for real-time analysis
🧪 Spent hours on prompt engineering to get accurate results

The hardest part wasn't the code - it was teaching the AI to recognize diverse foods (Indian thali vs. Western breakfast) and estimate realistic portions and macros.

**Key Features:**
✅ AI-powered food detection with macro breakdown
✅ Drag & drop + live camera capture
✅ Analysis history with export (JSON/CSV)
✅ Interactive nutrition charts & dark mode
✅ 95% faster than manual calorie tracking

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Qwen 2.5 VL, Chart.js, Multer

What started as a weekend project became a deep dive into multimodal AI and practical ML applications.

**🚀 What's Next:**
Currently working on exciting enhancements and a **mobile app version** - because let's be honest, we take food photos on our phones! Stay tuned for updates.

Curious to hear from folks working on similar health-tech or AI projects - what challenges have you faced with vision models?
